### 💻 Option 2: Run Locally on Your Computer

Follow these steps to run the project on your own machine.

#### Step 1: Install Python

| If you have | Check by running | Download if missing |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Python 3.12+** | `python --version` | [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) |
| **Git** | `git --version` | [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) |

> **Windows users:** During Python install, **check** the box "Add Python to PATH".

#### Step 2: Download the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vikasotageri/leave-management.git
cd leave-management
```

#### Step 3: Get Your API Keys (Required)

This project needs **3 things** to work fully. Follow the links below to get them:

| # | What you need | Why | How to get it (click link) | 🎥 Video Tutorial |
|---|--------------|-----|---------------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **OpenAI API Key** | Powers the AI Chat feature — without it, agents won't work | [🔑 Get OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) → Click "Create new secret key" → Copy the `sk-...` key | [📺 Watch: How to get OpenAI API Key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naQ9GXPvH6A) |
| 2 | **Gmail Account** | Sends welcome emails & credentials to new employees | [📧 Create Gmail](https://accounts.google.com/signup) (if you don't have one) | - |
| 3 | **Gmail App Password** | Lets the system send emails from your Gmail | [🔐 Create App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) → Select "Mail" → Generate → Copy 16-char password | [📺 Watch: How to create Gmail App Password](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh1nMpotyFo) |

> **📌 How to get Gmail App Password (step-by-step):**
> 1. Go to [myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
> 2. Sign in with your Gmail
> 3. Under "Select app" → choose **"Mail"**
> 4. Under "Select device" → choose **"Other (Custom name)"** → type `AI MSIS`
> 5. Click **"Generate"**
> 6. Copy the **16-character password** (looks like `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`) — spaces are OK, include them
>
> ❓ Don't see "App Passwords"? Enable **[2-Step Verification](https://myaccount.google.com/security)** first, then come back.

#### Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables

Now put those keys into a file so the system can read them.

```bash
# Create .env file from the template
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

**Where is this file?** Open the `leave-management` folder → open `backend` folder → find `.env` file. Open it in **Notepad** (Windows) or **TextEdit** (Mac) or **VS Code**.

**Replace the placeholder text with your actual keys:**

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
SECRET_KEY=any-random-string
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-gmail-app-password
```

| Variable | Required? | What to put | Example |
|----------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | ✅ **Required** | Paste the `sk-...` key from OpenAI | `sk-proj-AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz123456` |
| `SECRET_KEY` | ✅ **Required** | Any random text you make up | `mySuperSecretKey123!@#` |
| `SMTP_USER` | ✅ **Required for email** | Your full Gmail address | `vikasotageri234@gmail.com` |
| `SMTP_PASS` | ✅ **Required for email** | The 16-char password from Google | `abcd efgh ijkl mnop` |

> ⚠️ **All four fields are required** for the full system to work. Without OpenAI key → AI Chat won't work. Without SMTP → emails won't send.

**Save the file** (Ctrl+S) and close it.

#### Step 5: Start the Servers

```bash
bash start.sh
```

Wait 1-2 minutes. You'll see:

```
✅ All servers started!

  Role       | Dashboard                           | Port
  -----------|-------------------------------------|------
  Employee   | http://localhost:8001/employee      | 8001
  Manager    | http://localhost:8002/manager        | 8002
  HR         | http://localhost:8003/hr             | 8003
```

#### Step 5: Open in Browser

| Portal | URL | Login |
|--------|-----|-------|
| 🧑‍💼 HR | http://localhost:8003/hr | `hr@company.com` / `pass123` |
| 👔 Manager | http://localhost:8002/manager | `manager@company.com` / `pass123` |
| 👨‍💼 Employee | http://localhost:8001/employee | Created by HR |

#### 🚀 Deploy on Hugging Face Spaces (Live Server)

Want to put this online like the live demo? Follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Create a Hugging Face account at [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/join)

**Step 2:** Create a new Space:
   - Click your profile → **"New Space"**
   - **Space Name:** `leaveflow` (or any name)
   - **License:** MIT
   - **SDK:** Select **Docker**
   - Click **"Create Space"**

**Step 3:** Upload the code:
```bash
# In terminal, link your HF Space
git remote add hf https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/leaveflow
git push hf master:main
```

**Step 4:** Add secrets (Environment Variables):
   - Go to your Space → **Settings** tab → Scroll to **"Repository Secrets"**
   - Click **"New secret"** and add these one by one:

| Secret Name | Value | Where to get it |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `sk-...` | [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Any random string | Make one up, e.g. `mySecret123` |
| `SMTP_USER` | `your-email@gmail.com` | Your Gmail address |
| `SMTP_PASS` | `abcd efgh ijkl mnop` | [Google App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) |

   - 📺 **Video:** [How to set HF Space Secrets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyfSqDHDppM)

**Step 5:** Wait 2-3 minutes for the build. Your Space will be live at:
   ```
   https://YOUR_USERNAME-leaveflow.hf.space
   ```

> 💡 **Tip:** To redeploy after code changes, just `git push hf master:main` — HF auto-builds.

#### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `python: command not found` | Install Python, check "Add to PATH" during install |
| `pip: command not found` | Reinstall Python with "Add to PATH" |
| `Port 8001 already in use` | `kill $(lsof -ti:8001)` (Mac/Linux) or restart PC (Windows) |
| AI Chat not working | Check `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `backend/.env` is correct |
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` manually |
| Database error | Delete `backend/leave_management.db` and restart |

---

### 🔧 Option 3: Integrate Into Your Own Project

This project is modular. Take only what you need:

| What you want | What to copy |
|---------------|-------------|
| **AI Agents only** | `ai/` folder — standalone LangGraph multi-agent system |
| **Leave Management API only** | `backend/routers/` + `backend/database.py` |
| **Full system** | Fork the repo, change branding in `backend/templates/base.html`, deploy anywhere |
| **Frontend only** | `frontend/static/js/` — pure vanilla JS, no build step |

### 🔄 How a Leave Request Flows

```
1. Employee logs in → clicks "Apply Leave" → fills form → Submit
2. FastAPI checks: Is user logged in? Is date valid? Within limits?
3. If auto-approvable → saved as "Approved" ✅
4. If needs manager → saved as "Pending" → Manager notified 🔔
5. Manager approves/rejects → Employee notified 🔔
```

### 🔄 How AI Chat Works

```
1. Employee types "What is my leave balance?"
2. SUPERVISOR AGENT reads it → decides: "This is a Leave question"
3. Routes to LEAVE AGENT → calls database → gets balance
4. Returns: "You have 12 casual leaves remaining"
```

### 🤖 AI Agents Explained

**Supervisor Agent** — Like a receptionist. Reads your question and sends it to the right department.

**Specialist Agents** — Like department heads:

| Agent | Handles | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 📝 Leave Agent | Apply/cancel leaves | "Apply casual leave tomorrow" |
| ✅ Approval Agent | Approve/reject requests | "Approve John's leave" |
| 📋 Policy Agent | Policy questions | "What is the leave policy?" |
| 📊 Analytics Agent | Stats & reports | "How many approved today?" |
| 💬 General Agent | Other chat | "Hello" |

**LangGraph** — Framework that connects agents like pipes.

**GPT-4o-mini** — OpenAI's AI model that reads text and decides actions. Your data is NOT stored or used for training.

---

## 🎓 Purpose: Educational Project (Not Enterprise)

> ⚠️ **This is a LEARNING project** built to understand **how Agentic AI works** — how LLMs, prompts, tools, and agents work together. It is **not** a production-ready enterprise system.

> 🔑 **This project REQUIRES an OpenAI API key** (for AI Chat feature) and **Gmail credentials** (for email notifications). Both are free to set up — see Step 3 below.

### What This Project Teaches You

| Concept | How It's Demonstrated Here |
|---------|---------------------------|
| **🤖 Agentic AI** | Multiple AI agents (Supervisor + 5 Specialists) that make decisions autonomously |
| **🧠 LLMs (Large Language Models)** | GPT-4o-mini reads user messages and decides what action to take — no if-else chains |
| **📝 Prompt Engineering** | Each agent has a prompt that tells it what to do, what tools it has, and what NOT to do |
| **🔧 AI Tools / Function Calling** | Agents don't guess — they call real database functions (`get_leave_balance`, `apply_leave`, etc.) |
| **🔄 LangGraph Workflows** | Agents are connected in a graph — Supervisor → Specialist → Tool → Response |
| **🚫 No Hardcoding** | The AI understands "Apply for casual leave tomorrow" without parsing keywords. A traditional system would need rigid forms |
| **🔀 Multi-Agent Orchestration** | One supervisor delegates to specialists — like a manager delegating to teams |

### ❌ What This Project Is NOT

- ❌ **Not a replacement for SAP / Oracle / Workday** — those are enterprise-grade systems with 1000s of features
- ❌ **Not security-audited** — no penetration testing, no SOC2, no GDPR compliance
- ❌ **Not scalable** — SQLite (not PostgreSQL), single server (not load-balanced)
- ❌ **Not for production data** — don't put real employee PII here

### ✅ What This Project IS Good For

- ✅ **Learning how AI agents work** — see the full flow: user message → LLM → tool call → response
- ✅ **Understanding LangGraph** — trace how Supervisor routes to Specialists
- ✅ **Experimenting with prompts** — tweak `ai/agents/graphs.py` prompts and see how AI behavior changes
- ✅ **Testing LLM tool calling** — see how OpenAI's function calling integrates with Python
- ✅ **Building your own agentic system** — use this as a template for your own ideas

## 💼 Business Scenarios — What AI Can Do vs Traditional Coding

Below are real scenarios showing **why AI agents are powerful** compared to traditional hardcoded logic.

### Scenario 1: Ambiguous Natural Language

| 👤 User says | Traditional System | 🤖 AI Agent (This Project) |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| *"I need day after tomorrow off"* | ❌ Would fail — needs exact date format | ✅ Understands "day after tomorrow" → computes date → applies leave |
| *"Can I take Friday off?"* | ❌ Form only accepts dd-mm-yyyy | ✅ Understands "Friday" → finds next Friday → checks policy → applies |
| *"What leaves do I have left?"* | ❌ Must navigate to specific page | ✅ Understands intent → fetches balance → responds in English |
| *"Approve John's sick leave"* | ❌ Must find John in a list, click approve | ✅ Understands → finds John's pending sick leave → approves it |

**Why this matters:** Traditional systems force users to follow rigid menus and forms. AI agents understand **how humans actually talk**.

### Scenario 2: Multi-Step Reasoning

| 👤 User says | 🤖 AI Agent does |
|-------------|-----------------|
| *"Apply for 3 days casual leave from next Monday"* | 1. Figures out next Monday's date<br>2. Checks if casual leave allows 3 days at once<br>3. Checks monthly limit (2/month)<br>4. If 1st/2nd request → auto-approves. If 3rd → routes to manager<br>5. Returns result in plain English |
| *"Who's on leave this week?"* | 1. Determines current week dates<br>2. Queries all leaves in that range<br>3. Groups by employee<br>4. Returns: "John (casual, Mon-Wed), Sarah (sick, Tue)" |

**Why this matters:** A traditional system would need separate pages/APIs for each step. The AI agent chains multiple tool calls together based on what the user needs.

### Scenario 3: Policy Handling Without Hardcoding

| Approach | How it works |
|----------|-------------|
| **Traditional code** | Rules are hardcoded: `if leave_type == "casual" and count > 2: requires_approval()` — changing policy means changing code, redeploying |
| **AI Agent** | Policy is written in plain English in the prompt: *"First 2 casual requests/month auto-approved. 3rd+ → manager."* — changing policy means editing text, no code change |

**Example:** If the company changes policy from "2 casual leaves/month" to "3 casual leaves/month":
- **Traditional:** Find and update the if-condition in the code → re-deploy
- **AI Agent:** Edit one sentence in the prompt → restart server

### Scenario 4: Cross-Domain Questions

| Question | What the AI does |
|----------|-----------------|
| *"How many leaves did I take this year?"* | Queries leave records, counts by type, sums up |
| *"Show me everyone who joined this month"* | Filters employees by DOJ range |
| *"Who has the most remaining casual leave?"* | Calculates all balances, sorts descending, returns top |
| *"What's the policy on sick leave?"* | Reads policy prompt, explains in simple words |

**Why this matters:** Each question would need a separate API endpoint in a traditional system. Here, one AI + tools handles infinite question types.

### Scenario 5: Graceful Handling of Unknown Requests

| User says | Traditional System | AI Agent |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| *"Tell me a joke"* | ❌ Error / 404 | ✅ "I'm a leave management assistant — I can help with leaves, policies, and reports!" |
| *"What's the weather?"* | ❌ Error | ✅ "I don't have access to weather data. I can help with leave-related questions." |
| *"Translate hello to French"* | ❌ Error | ✅ Tells user what it CAN do |

**Why this matters:** Traditional systems crash or show errors on unexpected input. AI agents **know their boundaries** and guide users appropriately.

## 🔍 How Each Concept Maps to Code

| Concept | File | What to Look At |
|---------|------|----------------|
| **Prompt Engineering** | `ai/agents/graphs.py` | Each agent's prompt (LEAVE_PROMPT, APPROVAL_PROMPT, etc.) — plain English instructions |
| **Tool Definitions** | `ai/agents/tools.py` | Functions decorated with `@tool` — these are the "actions" agents can take |
| **Tool Schemas** | `ai/agents/supervisor.py` | How tools are described to the LLM (name, description, parameters) |
| **Agent Graph** | `ai/agents/graphs.py` | How agents connect — `StateGraph` with nodes and edges |
| **Supervisor Routing** | `ai/agents/supervisor.py` | `classify_intent()` — LLM decides which specialist handles the request |
| **LLM Call** | `ai/agents/supervisor.py` | `bind_tools()` — connects OpenAI function calling to Python functions |

## 💻 Environment Variables

This project needs **4 environment variables** to work fully:

| Variable | Required | Description | Where to get it |
|----------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | ✅ **Required** | OpenAI API key for AI Chat agents | [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | ✅ **Required** | JWT secret — any random string for login security | Make up any text (e.g. `mySecretKey123`) |
| `SMTP_USER` | ✅ **Required for email** | Gmail address that sends welcome emails | Your Gmail address |
| `SMTP_PASS` | ✅ **Required for email** | Gmail app password (16 chars) | [myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) |

### How to set them:

**For local development:** Edit `backend/.env` file (see [Step 4](#step-4-set-up-environment-variables))

**For Hugging Face Spaces:** Go to your Space → **Settings** → **Repository Secrets** → Add each one

> ❓ **Don't have a Gmail App Password?** Watch this: [📺 How to create Gmail App Password](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh1nMpotyFo)

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User enters email + password → POST `/api/auth/login`
2. Server verifies password → returns JWT token (valid 8 hours)
3. Browser stores token in `localStorage`
4. All future requests include `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
5. `GET /api/auth/me` returns current user info
